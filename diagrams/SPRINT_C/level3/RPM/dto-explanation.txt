In the level 3 process views diagrams we are not representing dto's to avoid cluttering the diagram and to facilitate the
understanding of the processes.

Having that said, here we'll have a small explanation of the dto's used in the RPM module.

For the RPM module we have three types of dto, inDto, outDto and viewDto:

inDto is used to receive data from the backend;
outDto is used to send data to the backend;
viewDto is used to display data in the view.

The component "Component" of the PV's diagrams uses the mappers to convert the dto's.

When it needs to send data to the "View" component, it uses the viewDto.
When it needs to send data to the "Service" component, it uses the outDto.
When it receives data from the "Service" component, it uses the inDto.
